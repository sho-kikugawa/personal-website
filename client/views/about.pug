			h4 About this site
			p 
			| For the longest time I didn't consider making a personal website, but a
			| friend inspired me to make one. On top of that, with some experience 
			| working with a MEAN stack for side project, I thought I could leverage
			| those skills to make this website.
			p
			| What you're seeing is something I think is easily digestable project to 
			| tackle using a MEAN stack. Which does indeed mean: 
			ul 
				li It runs on a Node.js + Express backend 
				li 
					| It uses MongoDB to store blog articles and retrieve them, so I  
					| don't have to create a new page every time I want to create an 
					| article.
				li 
					| The only part of the MEAN stack it doesn't use is the "A", as this 
					| website doesn't need a frontend framework as feature rich as Angular,
					| React, or others.
			p The source code for this website can be found on
